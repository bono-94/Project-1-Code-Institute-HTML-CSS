You will be doing what you want to do, whenever you want it to be done, and of course, however you want. You can work on any topic that ever existed, exists or will ever exist either what you would usually do in your day, or what needs to be done globally, completely up to you! No minimum qualifications are required and all procedures will be taught to you in our online learning environment.

                Payment Model Introduction:
            </h5>
            <p><em>All efforts and completed tasks will be rewarded during the Great Recalculation when all team and community members will determine what they are entitled to. Earnings will be multiplied based on specific qualifications and promotions. Your accumulated earnings can also be swapped for another user’s service at a tremendous discount in comparison to the current economy. For example, a property or a house in your dream country can be achieved quicker working for the world’s organization of humans instead of a company and owners that keep profits to themselves and don't help employees to achieve bigger things in life. The current owner and main developer of the entire concept have paid a high price to have the privilege to develop this project and worked without reimbursement for almost 20 years on it. Developer and owner prefers not to get wealthy in the end what suppose to belong to others nor that it takes that long for people to get reimbursement themselves. Intentions are to share profit with other people that can produce natural, sustainable, and healthy products and service that will positively change the course of humanity. Everyone will be set up independent and in full of control of their works with additional possibility to merge together into the new fields with other complimentary organisations creating more jobs and better working conditions globally. There will be no misleading here and success on other people’s backs. On contrary, we want to help you grow your own ideas and maximize your careers and personal progress. All profits from the first products and services will pay the labor and debts during or before the great redistribution before any upgrade or growth. This is a great opportunity for everyone that works on their passion outside of their regular jobs to create a large savings/spending money fund by continuing with your hobbies, ideas, or passions in life and submitting to us for rewards calculation. With the arrival of economics, financial and funding experts on our team, you can expect your earnings to skyrocket and make you one of the wealthiest humans during The Great Redistribution. You will be part of a new economy system with minimum double higher minimum wages for every human making under USD 100,000 per year.</em></p>
