- __Landing Quotation__

  - Calming effect of sunset background is allowing user to gradually enter the feeling of reflecting back on life and planning future during natural sun's cycles and impact on a human mind and body. This is where users can be shortly debriefed how besides these visuals, service can bring an utility value to them and allow more sunsets in more comfortable situation for them and the close ones. Being one of the hints of solution for users' problems or ideas font is given subtle effect of glowing as it seems to be an answer falling from the sky. Colors have been picked from top division of colors focusing on purple and black as their location on the page is also on the top. This also builds subliminal users' natural ability to further digest and separate high quantity of quality content

![Londing Quotation](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __About Section__

  - Once users' attention is present from landing elements, some highly important and new summarized information is given following the graphic media and captivating quotation. Here main business aspects, values and predicted journey is disclosed to the user as an about section or personal introduction for users to understand our positive intentions better and earlier

  - Styling has been add to emphasize horizontal division with black background such as sub-menu's role. Orange color brings deliberate high contrast to guide user from first-impression stage over the smooth bridge to actual content. Again, teal background indicates a boxed divider such as nav-menu to break down areas in familiar patterns for users

![About Section](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_times.png)

- __Home Headers__

  - The similar pattern landing image media includes an interactive photograph custom made for this website with color alternation to demonstrate the main topics and sections of the predominately informative home page. Headers with blue and white colors are representing the following features section where blue skies and white sun and clouds are main visuals. Orange and teal headers are the main colors and therefore subliminally indicating this is the most important area that contains full agenda and timeline of the Life Coin. This is the site's business strategy and priority highest priority next to the private sale. For private sale, header is black to create a full stop and divide important region and upon interaction also transparent showing through true body color as a deep methaphor or creating feeling of "transparency" when dealing with our financial service and project now or in the future
  
  
![3x Home Header Pictures](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_landing.png)

- __Features Section__

  - First main sections of the home page has been done with the best background visuals in order to step-by-step bring user from stage of introduction to content with basic background and font to the full-scale first-hand experience participating in our life reality and services

  - Having bright yellow color in the middle of logo has been an inspiration to use sun background as the title rising over the fixed blue skies on scroll separating all Life Coin's serice features. This section is one of the most important one for potential investors and has been done to a special design in order to always remind them when they look up in the sky

![Features Section](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Timeline Section__

  - Another home page main section that through main colors of the site and sleek clean and sharp text-shadow backgrounds creates categorized easy to digest process for users going through both agendas. Short-term and long-term have been clearly divided with horizontal teal box while main content has been ordered through yearly quarters and plans for users. This is also of high importance to investors but this time even for the team and community to know which periods and products are upcoming next

![Timeline Section](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Private Sale Section__

  - Being an unique coin in the entire universe that develops in a direction of universal physical and digital currency for whole Earth and beyond, stars backround has been added to the pre-sale section.

![Private Sale Section](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Recruitment__

  - Following the home page, second largest out of 4 sub-pages of Life Coin site is oriented in building relationship with the user after all values and solutions have been presented. Landing recrutiment page allows users to explore and determine if they would like to join our business team, build a relationship with our business or register as an actual consumer and community member. Those three categories of user have been each assigned a button to follow to the belonging page where further and detailed information is disclosed. Each button has descriptive sentence to indicate the next destination through formal pallete of colors shades on teal with sharp orange emphasis color. Header is of complimenting colors and coin design on it contracts within itself as a hovering effect such as pressing a button, subliminally telling the user he needs to select his one single button. As the screen size drops below PC size, header picture is not anymore floating left of the content boxes, but stretching full width above the content boxes

![Recruitment](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Team Recruitment__

  - Since the brand's associated products and services are based on education and business progress, main font background and coloring for employees and contractors recruitment is designed inspired by a traditional chalkboard. Information that is written there for everyone will stay permanent as the chalk and all the promises will be kept what user can benefit from on this section. In addition, presented list of all urgent positions sought opens real-life opportunities for all users. Main sections such as title for the careers and subtitle per job advertising segment are again colored with main colors of the page teal and orange. This time, another icon is introduced in order to add some variety between visuals. Background color to hovering over floating coin and all content has been matched with the body color and navigational menu light blue color to add the natural spacing instead of using white color to sloppy cut through smooth water/green experience offered to user through including various shades of teal

![Team Recruitment](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Business Recruitment__

  - Almost identical concept to the Team Recruitment features. The only difference is that different type of users browses and uses this part of the site growing business relationships, while another user follows other pathways such as joining community as a consumer or Team as an employee or contractor. Styling difference to give some distinction is in the main board with explanation of title Business Symbiosis. Since user could make many assumptions or give up not knowing, informative block has been added with sleek modern styling division between concepts and board advertisement. In contrast to Team page where user automatically understands concept almost intuitively by seeing many job postings that page with employment environment description, conditions, payment, open positions, and similar. Here user needs to be given a small explanation banner. Boxes on the business relationship page are slightly more distanced for better division between concepts emphasizing different models and possibilities for users with capitalization and font-increasement of the key words of each single box

![Business Recruitment](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Journey__

  - Usually when an user stumbles on the page with a big orange cone with a wording construction and that page is not built yet.This user rarely comes back bumping into a brick wall without any time frame for "construction works". What is trying to be achieved for our users in this part of the site is to disclose to the user that there are more features and plans in making or that we even completed the next version without losing the  excitement and smooth navigation. Instead we are informing the user that one of our completed sections cannot be open due to certain agenda milestones and already planned dates for launch. This converts any disappointing energy into the pure enthusiasm about the version update date. User gains another advantage of constanly positively looking forward to the next release while still being briefly introduced to the concept of the new page. Having gifts locked instead them being build in a "boring" factory, makes a child brain want them even more 

  - Once the target date reaches, this segment will allow the user to see exactly when the public meetings will happen, in which online or offline room and how long they will last next to the disclosure of the main topic or topics. Full site will eventually turn into full-scale progress collaboration software and a social network. Orange color dominates here as a subtle informing of construction progress which is usally associated with orange not teal color. However, user is primarily being guided to think it is locked and ready to launch for better long-term experience with strategic releasement of versions previously discussed

![Journey](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_times.png)

- __Registration__

  - The club ethos section will allow the user to see the benefits of joining the Love Running meetups, as well as the benefits of running overall. 
  - This user will see the value of signing up for the Love Running meetups. This should encourage the user to consider running as their form of exercise. 

![Club Ethos](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

  - This page will allow the user to get signed up to Love Running to start their running journey with the community. The user will be able specify if they would like to take part in road, trail or both types of running. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Love Running. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media
