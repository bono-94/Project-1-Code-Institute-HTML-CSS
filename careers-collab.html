            Concept:
        </h5>
        <p>We are constantly searching for new investors that believe in our project and team and wish to become shareholder of something that could be the biggest company that ever existed not leaving major companies any choice but to be small building block of what we are doing. We are always open for your proposals which is preferred in the format: Amount + percentage of ownership /  amount of tokens + maximum time willing to wait on return. (Please note that the first playout will be only during The Great Redistribution unless community, team and ownership collectively agrees on our priority on paying you instead our designated growth plan).</p>
        <br>
        <p>We are constantly searching for sponsors that are willing to stand behind our innovative and sustainable concept that is here to push humanity back to the right course. Now is your chance to place your brand in the associative marketing service. For every thought of our project in the future, our millions and billions of users will always have your company in consideration.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We are constantly looking for business organizations to create deeper connections between various topics and specializations. Well-established company or unknown that produces high-quality and fully sustainable products is urged to contact us how can we bridge our journeys in order to provide maximum life experience for both of our consumers. We are interested in the fusion of topics in order to create something new, useful and unique. What is the difference between collaborators and partners? Collaborators are usually independent humans or organizations that wishes to preform task for both of our users for maximum life experiences without any business relation or contracts of long-term fair co-operations. Partners are collaborators that wish to set up a new company that will provide mix of both of our services with shared ownership in ratios 50-50% or 49-51%. Alternatively they are allowed to invest half of theirs company in exchange to be associated with our global brand and be part of our business eco-system that contains every company and task that ever existed, exists or will ever exist. We allow our partners to specialize in their task how they always fantasized about while we focus on operational and business side of the newly formed company</p>
